# Jarvis-Green
Green AI energy manager for Tesla and homes 🌱

## About This Project
Hey @elonmusk, this is my dream: a sustainable AI that optimizes energy for Tesla cars and homes! Built by TuncayStark during night shifts, this project uses ML to save power and cut carbon footprints. Inspired by JARVIS, but greener! 😎

## Why?
- 🌍 Save the planet with smart energy use.
- 🚗 Make Tesla batteries last longer and charge smarter.
- 🤖 Learn ML/DL hands-on while studying my B.Sc. in AI & Sustainable Tech.

## Next Steps
- Build a basic ML model (3 months).
- Add a touch interface (6 months).
- Test it in a real home (1 year).

## Get Involved
Clone it, tweak it, make it better!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TuncayStark/Jarvis-Green.git
Note: Elon, if you see this, let’s chat about Mars energy! 🚀
